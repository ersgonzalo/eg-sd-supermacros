# EG-SD-SuperMacros
---
A series of personal macros that I use on my own Elgato Streamdeck. Regularly contribute and manage them as I want to automate more things that I do on the regular.

If you'd like to create your own, you reference the documentation here: https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-supermacro/wiki

Huge credits to:
- [BarRaider](https://github.com/BarRaider) for creating this plugin to make my life easier
- [Steve M](https://github.com/stevemar/code-reference-in-readme) for creating [a wonderful guide](https://www.stevemar.net/github-code-in-readme/) on how to easily refernce code blocks for easier display in Markdown files!
