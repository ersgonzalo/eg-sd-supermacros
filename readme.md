# EG-SD-SuperMacros
---
A series of personal macros that I use on my own Elgato Streamdeck. Regularly contribute and manage them as I want to automate more things that I do on the regular.

| Association | File | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| General | [general.md](general.md) | A series of helpful macros that I use often across different tools and for easier record-keeping. |
| Jira | [jira.md](jira.md) | A series of helpful macros that use the hotkeys and formatting that Jira supports. |
| Google Docs-like | [google-docs.md](google-docs.md) | Macros based on hotkeys and formatting that the Google Suite of Docs, Sheets, etc supports. |

Other Notes:
- SuperMacro doesn't discriminate in the file extension. I used `.sm` as the placeholder to differentate and reduce the risk of the system getting confused on possible compatibilities/safety.
